           The pynput and smtplib Python packages installed.
           
Setup:
  Clone this repository or download the source code files to your local machine.
  Install the required Python packages using the following command:
  Copy code
  pip install pynput smtplib
  Open the keylogger.py file in a text editor.

  To stop the keylogger, press the Esc key.

Logs and Email Delivery:

The captured keystrokes are stored in a local log file named keylogger.txt in the same directory as the keylogger.py file. Each time the keylogger is restarted, the log file is appended with new keystrokes. Make sure to clear the log file if needed. The keylogger periodically checks for an internet connection and sends the log file to the specified email address when a connection is available. If the keylogger fails to send the email, it will keep attempting until successful.
